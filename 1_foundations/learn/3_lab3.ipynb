I focused on separating business and UI logic with the View Model architecture, working with APIs to fetch and display data in the app.\\n\\nIn addition, I have also worked on creating an AI-powered pet health app, OPet, which is designed to provide information and support for pet owners. This project not only enhanced my skills in mobile development but also allowed me to integrate AI capabilities into a mobile solution.\\n\\nIf you would like more information about specific features or technologies used in these projects, feel free to ask!'"
