      "    \n",
      "    ### Ingredients:\n",
      "    - 1 whole chicken (about 4-5 lbs)\n",
      "    - 2-3 tablespoons olive oil or melted butter\n",
      "    - Salt and pepper\n",
      "    - Fresh herbs (like rosemary, thyme, or parsley) – optional\n",
      "    - 1 lemon, halved – optional\n",
      "    - 4-5 garlic cloves, smashed – optional\n",
      "    - Vegetables (like carrots, potatoes, onions) – optional for roasting alongside\n",
      "    \n",
      "    ### Instructions:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).\n",
      "    \n",
      "    2. **Prepare the Chicken**: \n",
      "       - Remove the chicken from packaging and pat it dry with paper towels.\n",
      "       - Trim any excess fat and remove the giblets from the cavity if present.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    3. **Season the Chicken**: \n",
      "       - Rub the olive oil or melted butter all over the chicken, including under the skin if possible.\n",
      "       - Generously season with salt and pepper both inside and outside. \n",
      "       - If using, place halved lemon, smashed garlic, and herbs inside the cavity for added flavor.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    4. **Add Vegetables (Optional)**: \n",
      "       - If you’d like to roast vegetables, chop them into large pieces and place them around the chicken in the roasting pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    5. **Roast the Chicken**: \n",
      "       - Place the chicken breast side up in a roasting pan or on a wire rack set over a baking sheet.\n",
      "       - Roast in the preheated oven for about 1 hour to 1 hour and 20 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C) in the thickest part of the thigh. Baste the chicken with pan juices halfway through if desired.\n",
      "    \n",
