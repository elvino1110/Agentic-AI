# Design for `accounts.py` Module

The `accounts.py` module contains the main class `Account` that manages user accounts for a trading simulation platform. Below is a detailed outline of the classes and methods within this module:

## Class: `Account`

### Attributes:
- `user_id` (str): Unique identifier for the user.
- `balance` (float): Current available cash balance for the user.
- `initial_deposit` (float): The initial amount of money deposited into the account.
- `holdings` (dict): A dictionary with stock symbols as keys and the quantities held as values.
- `transactions` (list): A list to record all transactions with details such as type, symbol, quantity, and price.

### Methods:

#### `__init__(self, user_id: str, initial_deposit: float) -> None`
Initializes the account with a user ID, sets the initial deposit, and initializes the balance, holdings, and transactions.

#### `deposit_funds(self, amount: float) -> None`
Adds funds to the balance.

#### `withdraw_funds(self, amount: float) -> bool`
Attempts to withdraw funds from the balance. Returns `True` if successful, `False` otherwise (e.g., if the withdrawal would result in a negative balance).

#### `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
Records the purchase of a specified quantity of shares. Returns `True` if the purchase is successful (i.e., if the user has enough funds to complete the purchase), `False` otherwise.

#### `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
Records the sale of a specified quantity of shares. Returns `True` if the sale is successful (i.e., if the user holds enough shares to sell), `False` otherwise.

#### `get_portfolio_value(self) -> float`
Calculates and returns the total current value of the user's portfolio (sum of cash balance and current value of holdings).

#### `get_profit_or_loss(self) -> float`
Calculates and returns the profit or loss based on the initial deposit and current portfolio value.

#### `get_holdings(self) -> dict`
Returns the current holdings of the user in terms of stock symbols and quantities.

#### `get_transaction_history(self) -> list`
Returns a list of all the transactions made by the user over time.

### Helper Function:

#### `get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float`
A stand-alone function provided outside the class which returns the current fixed price of a share for symbols like 'AAPL', 'TSLA', 'GOOGL'.

## Example Usage
Here is a small code snippet demonstrating the use of `Account` class:
```python
from accounts import Account

# Creating an account with user_id 'user123' and an initial deposit of $10,000
account = Account(user_id='user123', initial_deposit=10000.0)

# Deposit additional funds
account.deposit_funds(2000.0)

# Buy some shares
if account.buy_shares('AAPL', 10):
    print("Shares bought successfully.")
else:
    print("Could not complete purchase.")

# Check portfolio value
print('Portfolio Value:', account.get_portfolio_value())

# Withdraw funds
if account.withdraw_funds(500.0):
    print("Withdrawal successful.")
else:
    print("Could not complete withdrawal.")

# Get current holdings
print('Holdings:', account.get_holdings())

# Get transaction history
print('Transactions:', account.get_transaction_history())
```

This implementation ensures that all user actions are tracked, the portfolio value is consistently updated, and restrictions are enforced to maintain account integrity. The design anticipates changes in the pricing function and can test against fixed prices in its current setup.

This design provides a comprehensive outline of how to implement the account management system in a single Python module, ensuring that all user requirements and constraints are met.
